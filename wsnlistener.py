#Needs:

#Receipt method that receives an array from a sensor and patches it into the 'live' one

#Reboot signal method

#Warning method for logging the addys of nodes that havent been tripped in a while
#to mark them for maintenance attention

#Access token: screen incoming connections by making the sensor nodes first send out
#a security token. No token means we dont save the node. Tech we use is pretty
#easy to fuck with.

#possible sensor report format: Sender ID, speed int (low res), rising or falling direction
